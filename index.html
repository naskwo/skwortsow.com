          <p>Alexander Skwortsow was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk#Music" target="_blank">Novosibirsk</a>, Siberia in 1944. He began his musical studies as a not-so-enthusiastic piano student.</p>
          <p>His mother, concert pianist Galina Sintseva (aunt of <a href="http://www.leonidsintsev.com/es/?page=bio" target="_blank">Leonid Sintsev</a>) started teaching her son at the age of six, and for four years supervised his lessons and his practice. Then fate intervened.</p>
          <p>In a short period of time two significant events occurred in the young artist&#x27;s life - he was in the audience of Novosibirsk&#x27;s Philharmonia Hall when a spirited gypsy group performed, and he heard the legendary violinist David Oistrakh.</p>
          <p>&quot;After that the piano sound was so dead&quot; for the growing musician and he switched to the violin. His mother, who previously had to force him to practice his piano lessons, found herself asking her son &quot;not to practice the violin so much&quot;, however, she became a strong supporter of his new-found passion.</p>

          <p>At the age of 10, Alexander Skwortsow entered Novosibirsk&#x27;s prestigious violin school, giving his first solo concert at age 16 with the Novosibirsk Philharmonic Orchestra (Wienawski&#x27;s 1st Violin Concerto and Vieuxtemps 4th). He twice obtained first prize in the national youth music competition for the entire U.S.S.R.</p>

          <p>Skwortsow developed a strong interest in folk music and at age 19 he made an expedition to Russia&#x27;s northern provinces to tape those peoples&#x27; music and transcribe it on paper. He felt that the music had to be written down or it would be lost forever.</p>
          <p>After playing with the Novosibirsk Philharmonic, Skwortsow entered the Leningrad Conservatory as a full-time student in the conducting and orchestral soloist Master class programs, where he explored a number of interesting musical ideas that helped him develop as a musician. He was invited to join a string quartet, and studied conducting as well as the violin.</p>
          <p>At 22 he joined the Leningrad Philharmonic while continuing to study with two exceptional violin teachers, Professor Boris Sergeiff (whose forte was the traditional, academic repertoire) and Moscow&#x27;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Goldstein" target="_blank">Boris Goldstein</a>, who was known for his command of virtuosic violin literature.</p>
          <p>Skwortsow incorporated these two different approaches in his playing.</p>
          <p>In 1977, Skwortsow emigrated to the Netherlands where he became First Violinist with the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and Primarius in the Rotterdam String Quartet.</p>
          <p>In 1982, after several successful seasons with the Rotterdam Philharmonic, Skwortsow was invited to become First Concertmaster of the Luebecker Philharmonic in Germany.</p>
          <p>Between 1982 and 1987, Skwortsow received critical acclaim for his solo-performances and recitals, including his numerous Bach- and Mozart performances.</p>
          <p>In 1987, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra invited Skwortsow to become the First Concertmaster of their orchestra, which was on the verge of bankruptcy at the time.</p>
          <p>Skwortsow agreed and gave several unforgettable benefit-concertos with the Symphony, after which he remained concertmaster for two more years.In 1990, Skwortsow moved back to The Netherlands to focus more on his solo and recording career.</p>
          <p>Mr. Skwortsow&#x27;s acclaimed tours have taken him to France, the United States, Portugal, Monte Carlo and Japan, amongst others.</p>
